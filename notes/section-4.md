## Widgets

- ```MaterialApp``` and ```Scaffold``` are to android, what ```CupuertinoApp``` and ```CupertinoPageScaffold``` are to iOS.
- ```Container```, ```Row``` and ```Column``` are useful layout widgets.
- ```Flexible``` and ```Expanded``` are different row and column implementations/children respectively.
- ```Stack``` for nested widgets on top of each other.
- ```Card``` is a pretty container with some styles.
- ```ListView``` a scrollable column, ```GridView``` scrollable grid, ```ListTile``` list item with some layout setup.
- ```Text```, ```Image```, ```Icon``` are content widgets.
- ```TextField```, ```RaisedButton```, ```FlatButton```, ```GestureDetector```, ```InkWell``` are button widgets, the last couple of them don't have a physical existence but are useful around elements and add functionality.
